# Monogame Template
Template for cleanly-building Monogame projects.

I don't like IDEs -- I created this so I could use the Linux command line.

This is probably against a lot of best practices. To use it, replace instances of 'MonoFT' with the name of your project.

To build and run: `./build.sh`
